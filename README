Prerequisites:
OS: Windows;
Devices: TI IWR1642BOOST + DCA1000EVM;
Device connection: Figure 19 in DCA1000EVM User Guide (http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruij4a/spruij4a.pdf);
IWR1642 Firmware: mmWave Demo image (refer to mmwave_sdk_user_guide.pdf);
IWR1642BOOST mode: SOP-4 mode (Table 4 in http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/swru521b/swru521b.pdf);

Files Description:
\DCA1000: Scripts and binaries to connect, configure and trigger DCA1000EVM;
\DCA1000\Custom-build: currently used scripts and binaries for DCA manipulation;
\DCA1000\Pre-build: [Abandoned] Pre-build binary script by TI co.;
\Python4IWR: Python script to config and trigger IWR1642BOOSt;
\Python4IWR\config_and_wait_key.py: Currently used IWR config and trigger script;
\Python4IWR\cfg: Currently used IWR configuration file;
\IWR1642: [Abandoned] Scripts and binaries to connect, configure and trigger IWR1642BOOST;
\LUAShell: [Abandoned] Lua shell to configure and trigger frames, invoke by mmWave Studio;


Usage:
1.Connect and power on DCA+IWR devices
2.Open cmd and change to DCA1000\Custom-build\Release\ directory
3.Run DCA1000EVM_CLI_Control.exe fpga cf.json
This script will automatically connect and configure DCA1000
If success status is returned by last step, then:
4.Create Data/ folder in current directory, which will be used to store captured data
5.Run DCA1000EVM_CLI_Record.exe start_record cf.json [file_prefix]
[file_prefix] should be sustituted with your own file prefix
If success status is returned by last step, then:
6.Open another cmd and change to Python4IWR\
7.Run config_and_wait_key.py with python3
This script will automatically connect and configure IWR1642BOOST, and wait for keyboard input to traigger frames
8.Press Enter key to trigger mmwave frames
9.Press Enter key again to stop mmwave frames
10.Check DCA1000\Custom-build\Release\Data folder for captured data
If the DCA executable file can not run on your platform, please rebuild them from source code.
If you want to switch file prefix incrementally, try to use DCA1000\PCustom-build\run.py after step-4;

Cheers!
