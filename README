This repository contains scripts to capture raw data without mmWave Studio from TI's DCA1000EVM+IWR1642BOOST mmWave sensors.
You may custom your own data capturing and processing applications based on this repo.
Should you have any questions, feel free to contact me by zhangyithu@163.com.
Enjoy~

Prerequisites:
OS: Windows;
Devices: TI IWR1642BOOST + DCA1000EVM;
Device connection: Figure 19 in DCA1000EVM User Guide (./Doc/DCA1000EVM User Guide.pdf);
IWR1642 Firmware: mmWave Demo image (page 8-9 in ./Doc/mmWave Sdk User Guide.pdf);
IWR1642BOOST mode: SOP-4 mode (Table 4 in ./Doc/IWR1642BOOST User Guide.pdf);
MinGW tool installed (http://www.mingw.org/);
Build your own DCA1000 executable in ./DCA1000/Custom-build with MinGW tool;


Files Description:
./DCA1000/Custom-build/Release: executable for DCA1000 build on your own PC;
./Python4IWR: Python script for IWR1642BOOST;
./Python4IWR/cfg: IWR1642BOOST configuration file in which profile.cfg is in use (the meaning of fields are in page 18-31 of ./Doc/mmWave Sdk User Guide.pdf);
./Python4IWR/config_and_wait_key.py: Config IWR1642BOOST and wait for ENTER key to toggle sensors;
Others: Do NOT modify or delete;

Build ./DCA1000/Custom-build with MinGW tool:
1. Download and install mingw-get-setup.exe from http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started;
2. Add C:\MinGW\bin to system path (suppose your mingw is installed in C:\MinGW);
3. Install mingw32-make, gcc, g++ with the following command (users from CN should bypass the GFW):
"mingw-get install mingw32-make gcc g++"
4. Open cmd as Admin and switch to ./DCA1000/Custom-build directory;
5. Run "mingw32-make clean";
6. Run "mingw32-make" to build;
7. Check ./DCA1000/Custom-build/Release for the files DCA1000EVM_CLI_Record.exe and DCA1000EVM_CLI_Control.exe;

Usage:
1.Connect and power on DCA+IWR devices
2.Open cmd and change to ./DCA1000/Custom-build/Release/ (make sure that you have built ./DCA1000/Custom-build with MinGW)
3.Run 'DCA1000EVM_CLI_Control.exe fpga cf.json'
This script will automatically connect and configure DCA1000
If success, then:
4.Create Data/ folder in ./DCA1000/Custom-build/Release/, which will be used to store the captured data
5.Run 'DCA1000EVM_CLI_Record.exe start_record cf.json [file_prefix]'
[file_prefix] should be sustituted with your own file prefix
If success, then:
6.Open another cmd and change to Python4IWR\
7.Run config_and_wait_key.py with python3
This script will automatically connect and configure IWR1642BOOST with ./Python4IWR/cfg/profile.cfg, and wait for ENTER key to toggle sensor
8.Press Enter key to start mmwave sensor
9.Press Enter key again to stop mmwave sensor
10.Check ./DCA1000/Custom-build/Release/Data folder for captured data
NOTE:
Build your own DCA1000 executable with MinGW tool, otherwise the DCA1000 would not work.

Cheers!
